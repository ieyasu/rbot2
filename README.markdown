rbot2
=====

Once upon a time there was an evil scientist lurking in his cave. And he decided: "IRC doesn't have enough bots!" So he made one.
It was kind of like in Iron Man where Tony Stark was locked in this crazy chamber with a bunch of random parts. And he told his
captors "I NEEDZ MORE PARTZ" so they gave him more partz. And eventually he built an Arc Reactor and stuff, and the crazy Iron
Man suit. Well rbot2 isn't an Arc Reactor-powered suit like Tony Stark's. But it's CLOSE ENOUGH...

Usage
-----

How you use this thing is a total mystery... but as far as the Old Ones have been able to decipher, this is basically what
you need to do:

* git clone git@github.com:ieyasu/rbot2.git
* bundle install
* rake
* ???
* PROFIT!

Examples

Here's a very clear and consise guide about how to write rbot2 modules:
